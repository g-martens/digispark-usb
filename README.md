# RubberDucky Alternative
For people who won't buy RubberDucky, DigiSpark Attiny85 is the solution. Because it's possible to use it as HID (Human Interface Device) thanks to "DigiKeyboard.h" 

## What's here?
I have created this repo for sharing my payloads for DigiSpark. 
All the payloads are tested on Attiny85 and created on Arduino IDE.

## Getting Started
For people like me who are new to this i would suggest visiting [Maker.pro](https://maker.pro/arduino/projects/how-to-build-a-rubber-ducky-usb-with-arduino-using-a-digispark-module) for instruction on setting up development environment for Attiny85.

## Payloads
The Following below is the list of payloads i have worked on
